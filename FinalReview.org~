* week 1. 


** #include brings in declarations
   - cin >>; cout <<; 
   - iostream defines >> and << for all primitive data types
** class - two parts
   - interface: public
   - implementation: internal, private
** object life time
   1. born: *allocation then construction*
   2. live and interact with other objects
   3. die. *destruction then deallocation*
*** scope :: visibility/accessibility
    {
      Circle c( 0, 0, 1 );
    // Circle c is  in scope
      {
      int c = 0; // Circle c is  hidden by int c
    // int c is  in scope
      }
    _// Circle c is back  in scope_
    // int c is  out of scope
    }
    // both the objects named c are  out of scope
** functions
   float square( float x )
   {
     return x * x;
   }
   ---------------------
   type name (parameterType parameterName)
   {the statement }
   
   - function must be declared before call. 

** main
   int main()  int is the exit status
   return 0 means program terminated ok
   
** about intergral types and floating point types
   3 ways to define value
   int i = 3.4 (convert to 3)
   int i{3.4} raise error: floating-point to integer conversion
   int i = {3.4} same error. =is redundant
