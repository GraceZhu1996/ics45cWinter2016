/*3. (30 points) Write a third main that presents a (text-based) menu interface to your program that
  allows the user to deposit change, extract change, and to print the balance in a single coins object
  called myCoins. Be sure you don't allow someone to extract more money than they have. (Yes, I know
  this is probably trivial for most of you, but I want you to get some practice with the C++ while and switch).*/
